-- VII.1 Projects, Ex3: Article Response
--
-- the article "A.I. Companies Are Eating Higher Education"
--
-- OpenAI built a 99.9% accurate ChatGPT detector and decided not
--  to release it because users might switch to competitors. Which tells you
--  everything about where their priorities actually are.
--
-- I do think the article disagrees with all AI use though. There's a
-- difference between pasting an essay prompt into ChatGPT and using
-- AI to brainstorm project ideas (which is literally what we did for
-- Problem 1).
--
-- The biggest gap in the article he says universities need to "fight back"
-- but never says how. Release the detector, or jsut accept the true that students will be
-- using AI, so design better assignments. That would be a start.
